<p>Welcome to Module 1 of our Information Literacy Series - Research Questions and Search Strategies.

<h2>Introduction</h2>


Research involves the collection, organization, and analysis of information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue.

At a general level, research has three steps: 



1. Pose a question.  
2. Collect data to answer the question. 
3. Present an answer to the question. 

This should be a familiar process. You engage in solving problems every day and you start with a question, collect some information, and then form an answer.

Part one of this series pertains to research questions and search strategies which occurs in step 1 of the research process - Pose a question.

#### About Course-in-a-Box

P2PU created Course-in-a-Box in 2014 as a free and lightweight tool for building online courses. We wanted to preserve the modular structure of MOOCs outside of the bulky (and often proprietary) environment of learning/content management systems. Course-in-a-Box is open-source, and we welcome contributions [on our Github repo](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box).

p.s. Designing a course for learning circles? [Check out the Learning Circle Course Creation guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/116fJM3GS7XDzilUOL_ynMZ0yTncUD6aVUbcQKsTra6U/edit#heading=h.l36tzg40xcgr) for some best practices on course design.
