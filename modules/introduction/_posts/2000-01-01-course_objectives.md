## Introduction

Research involves the collection, organization, and analysis of information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue.

At a general level, research has three steps: 



1. Pose a question.  
2. Collect data to answer the question. 
3. Present an answer to the question. 

This should be a familiar process. You engage in solving problems every day and you start with a question, collect some information, and then form an answer.

Part one of this series pertains to research questions and search strategies which occurs in step 1 of the research process - Pose a question.
